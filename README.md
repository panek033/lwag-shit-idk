So, <@1265497312004935879> known also as lwag is a complete paster, idk if I can even name him a paster, cuz he doesnt even know how to change a fucking aimbot key.
Whats even funnier, he doesnt know how to enable debugging in a src I have sold him, it is the most simple thing ever (change int from 0 to 1 üíÄ). 
The main reason for me to expose him, is that he claims that the source I have sold him, was made by him..... imagine. 
The Next thing is, that he cant swap colors in a menu. 
The AVX old source, that he currently wants to leak, is only the menu I have remade by myself, and sold to him for 20$ in blue color, and after some time he comes to my dms and asks for purple version and that he will pay me ten. 
Also as I am writing this, he says complete nonsense in my dms (screenshot).
Please dont buy nor sell anything to him, cuz either your source will be leaked in 10 different dms by him, or he will nonstop ask for help (he couldnt find aimbot code when it is clearly in aimbot.h file....)
Oh and also, even if u will sell him something, dont go first... I have trusted this kid, and I was waiting for my money for likeee 2 or maybe even 3 weeks. 
When I was asking him about it, he said on his MOM that he will pay me "today" (proof on screenshots). 
And yes, I've spent 10 minutes of my life writing this, only because this guy is a retard, and I dont want anyone to fall for his words. Keep yall safe ‚ò∫Ô∏è![colorswapfor10dolla](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19849951-71d1-486a-8708-02381ddd7b8d)
